#CGCookie Paths

A React-based application showing the course path to take to learn various
digital and traditional arts.

Note that not all paths are finished, but the application is in working order,
and Heroku ready. There are many more additions to be made over time, and will
later be added. Check the Todo.md to see the active "to-do" list.
